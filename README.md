# Yeet2 MIPS simulator

A C++ MIPS simulator to simulate the behaviour of MIPS assembly instructions. 

## To setup

The following command would compile and build the simulator: 

```bash
$ make simulator
```

The following command would compile and build the testbench: 

```bash
$ make testbench
```

A few MIPS assembly code files have been pre-installed in this repository. To run these, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./testbench bin/mips_simulator
```
